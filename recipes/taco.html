  <h3>This tastes very close to the taco seasoning favored by a very popular fast-food taco restaurant. You can make this at home, and let your family prepare tacos the way they like.</h3>
  <ul> <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons corn flour</li>
    <li>4 ½ teaspoons chili powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon cumin</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried minced onion</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon beef bouillon granules</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground red pepper</li>
    <li>1 ⅓ pounds lean ground chuck</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
  </ul>

  <ol> <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>In a medium bowl, combine the corn flour, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and seasoned salt. Stir in the paprika, cumin, garlic salt, and sugar. Blend in the onion, bouillon, and ground red pepper, stirring until all spices are well blended.</li>
    <li> Crumble the ground chuck into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until browned. Remove from heat, rinse meat with hot water, and drain water and grease from beef.</li>
